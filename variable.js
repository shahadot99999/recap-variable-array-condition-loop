/* What is JavaScript ?
    Ans : javascript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. 

How does JS Works ?
    The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute.In contrast, JavaScript has no compilation step.Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it.

What is Variable ?

    Variable means anything that can vary.In JavaScript, a variable stores the data value that can be changed later on.
Use the reserved keyword var to declare a variable in JavaScript.

    Syntax:
var <variable-name>;
    var <variable-name> = <value>;

        Declare a variable in javascript?

        Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
        let carName = "Volvo";
        In the example below, we create a variable called carName and assign the value "Volvo" to it.


        How many types of variables in javascript ?

        Variables can be used to store data in a program, such as strings, numbers, JSON objects, or boolean values. In JavaScript, there are three different variable types: var , let , and const .

        JavaScript has seven types. Types are values that JavaScript can have. Below is a list of data types that JavaScript can have:
        Number
        String
        Boolean
        Undefined
        Null
        Object
        Symbol

        6.  how to find type of a variable in javascript ?

        typeof  find variable in java script.
        Use the typeof operator to get the type of an object or variable in JavaScript.
        Example: typeof
        var str = "this is string"; typeof str; // returns string

        The typeof operator also returns the object type created with the "new" keyword.

        7. primitive and non primitive data types in javascript?

        The Primitive Data types in JavaScript include Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null and Symbol.
        The Non-Primitive data type has only one member i.e. the Object.

        8.Naming Convention of JS variables?

        Each variable should have a name that appropriately identifies it. Your JavaScript code gets easier to comprehend and work with when you use suitable variable names.

        9. Math operators javascript?

        Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers: +, -, *, /, %

        10. Short hand: +=, -=, *=, /=?
        Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

        11. ++, --
        Increase, Decrease
        12. parseInt, ParseFloat
        parseInt is for converting a non integer number to an int and parseFloat is for converting a non float (with out a decimal) to a float (with a decimal).
        If your were to get input from a user and it comes in as a string you can use the parse method to convert it to a number that you can perform calculations on.

        13. tofixed javascript

        The toFixed() method in JavaScript is used to format a number using fixed-point notation. It can be used to format a number with a specific number of digits to the right of the decimal.
        Syntax:
        number.toFixed( value ) */
